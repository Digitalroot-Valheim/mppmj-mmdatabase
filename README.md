<b>MMORPG Database</b>

<i>Language</i>: SQL (SQLite)

This project designed and created a database to maintain user data
for a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (a MMORPG). The database
organizes, stores, and maintains user account, payment, and character data.

The database includes payment, account, character, guild, quest, location, weapon,
and achievement tables. The guild, quest, location, weapon, and achievement tables store
data associated with specific characters.

The end users of the database would be the game developers and any other relevant
employees (billing, accounting, customer service) requiring certain information.
